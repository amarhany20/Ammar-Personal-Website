# Ammar Personal Website

This is my personal website where I show all about my headline, summary, description, contact emails, and contact phones. It includes my skills, education, experience, certificates, letters of recommendation, and top projects. Additionally, it has my portfolio and my resume.

## Overview

This app is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

I designed it to help sort everything using partials. There is an `index.html` file that connects different HTML files as sections. Each section represents a different part of the website: navbar, landing, footer, education, certificates, recommendation letters, skills, top projects, and experience.

The website is connected to my Google Drive using redirects, allowing me to link this website anywhere on LinkedIn as a static link. This setup ensures that if I change any documents, the papers can get updated in the redirection without affecting the original link.
